/*
how it works 
User Accesses the Page

URL Example:
https://example.com (no query parameter)
OR https://example.com?query=AI+Startup (with a query parameter).
The Home component is rendered by Next.js.
Fetching the query Parameter

Next.js passes the searchParams as a promise to the Home component.
The promise resolves to the query parameters in the URL. For example:
If URL is https://example.com?query=AI+Startup, then searchParams resolves to { query: "AI Startup" }.
If no query is provided (https://example.com), then searchParams resolves to {}.
Query Extraction


const query = (await searchParams).query;
The query is extracted from the resolved object.
It could be a string (e.g., "AI Startup") or undefined if no query is provided.
Rendering the Page

The Home component renders:
Static content (heading, subheading).
The SearchForm component with the query passed as a prop.
The SearchForm pre-fills the input field with the value of query (if present).
